# Advent of Code 2025

_in which I attempt to use a different language every day_

## Rules

* If I've already used a language, no using it on a subsequent day
* Languages can't be too similar (e.g. Python 3 and Python 2 count as the same language)
* If I have to switch languages for part 2, both languages are "used up"
* Try to use the weirdest/most difficult/most unfamiliar language I think I'm capable of solving the puzzle in (within a reasonable timeframe)
* If a language has limited input facilities and requires another language to preprocess the input, that other language doesn't count as used
