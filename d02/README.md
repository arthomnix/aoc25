# Day 2

|                   |                   |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Language          | jq                |
| Input Method      | File              |
| Output Method     | stdout            |

## Running
```sh
jq -Rf day2.jq <path to input file>
```

## Notes
This one was actually much easier than expected (much easier than yesterday at least), and I accidentally solved part 2 whilst debugging part 1. I feel like I probably could have used a more difficult language here.
