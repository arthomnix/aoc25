# Day 6

|                   |                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Language          | TeX (LaTeX)           |
| Input Method      | File (hardcoded path) |
| Output Method     | PDF document          |

## Running
Place your input file in `inputs/real/day6.txt` relative to the root of the repository.

Then compile `day6.tex` using your favourite TeX engine - I use `tectonic`, but the standard
`pdflatex`/`xelatex`/`lualatex` should all work fine too.

## Notes
Dealing with the spaces in the input for part 2 required some proper TeX category code shenanigans™
