# Day 10

|                   |                   |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Language          | Hy                |
| Input Method      | File              |
| Output Method     | stdout            |

## Running
Requires `hyrule` and `scipy` in addition Hy itself (install via pip).

Then
```sh
hy day10.hy <path to input file>
```

## Notes
If I had known today would be an integer linear programming problem I wouldn't have used Picat yesterday...
At least this is a Python-based language so I could use scipy.optimize.
