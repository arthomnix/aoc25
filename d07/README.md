# Day 7

|                   |                   |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Language          | sed               |
| Input Method      | File              |
| Output Method     | stdout            |

## Running
Both scripts have a shebang, so you can just do
```sh
./part1.sed <path to input file>
./part2.sed <path to input file>
```

## Notes
Probably the most difficult language I've used so far.

The width of the input is hardcoded, so if you want to run this on a different size input
you will need to modify the scripts. Also, be warned that part 2 took around two and a half
minutes to run on my (reasonably fast) laptop.
